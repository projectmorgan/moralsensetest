Anyway, because we shunt users over to this other website in order to view their results, there's no way for the app to connect with our SQL database, which is hosted by webfaction (the same server where the website lives). Essentially, the way we've dealt with this is to scrape the SQL database for the user's average scores on each of the three tests in submitDataSTUDYNAME.php. We then pass all of the scores (if they exist) as variables in the query string to Shiny. Once the *current* data has been successfully inserted in SQL, we *return* a link (such as **moral.shinyapps.io?curr=empathy&empav=3.5&disav=2.3&morav=4.4**) which the window redirects to. "
